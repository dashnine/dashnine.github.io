## Data
Much like the excellent [Star Wars character generator by OggDude](http://www.legendsofthegalaxy.com/Oggdude/) this application does not include descriptions; you are expected to own and use the books while creating or editing your character.  If you own the books and would like to enter the descriptions yourself, this functionality is supported by editing the _user_descriptions_ in the database.  Note that in early releases, databases schemas may change; efforts will be made to provide assistance in migrating exported data in new releases if/when this occurs.

This application utilizes a Sqlite database to store key data such as schools, clans, and families; this database is copied on run to a platform-dependent application directory (e.g. the AppData/Local/PaperBlossoms directory on Windows), and a warning will appear whenever the application's bundled data file is older than the local copy (or the local copy is missing). 
If you would like to add custom data ('cause who doesn't want to be a Cat clan shinobi, eh?) you can do so by editing the *user_* tables in the database--for now, using a tool such as [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/).

Basic export and import functionality have been provided in the tools menu.  By selecting *Export User Data Tables...* and choosing a folder, you can dump the user_ tables to that folder.  Selecting *Import User Data Tables...* will attempt to import these CSVs.  _This is limited functionality provided for convenience, and may render your DB unusuable in the event of a problem or schema change. Always back up your data if you're concerned about this._  If you enter custom data, be sure to export it to save your work.

## Contributing
Paper Blossoms is written in C++, with Qt5. Application data is stored in a sqlite database, and accessed exclusively through the interface provided in dataaccesslayer.cpp -- any new queries to the data should be made there.  Save files have version numbers associated; going forward, modifications will attempt to use these version numbers to check and handle save file compatibility.  I'm happy to accept and review pull requests, and will be populating tasks and feature requests on this github page!  A general overview of the code is in the wiki, and we hope to have more added in the near future.

If you would like to make a contribution to the data, consult the [data contribution guide](PaperBlossoms/data/README.md).

If you would like to contribute a translation of the UI, you'll need to modify a .ts file for your locale.  I've added notes [here](https://github.com/dashnine/PaperBlossoms/wiki/Translation).
