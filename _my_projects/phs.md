PHS is an independent production by **Snow Dog Labs** and is not affiliated with **Need Games** or **Rooster Games**. It is published under the **Fabula Ultima Third-Party Tabletop License 1.0**.

## What does PHS stand for?

I could claim that PHS stands for **Player's Handbook Software**—a reference to the Player's Handbook, a core rulebook for many tabletop roleplaying games. I could also note that a **Personal Handy-phone System** was a common mobile phone system in Japan at one time, and that a certain JRPG series punned off of this when it created the "Party Hensei System" for editing the party. Perhaps PHS stands for **"Please Help Snowdog"**, a plea for assistance in the development of this software. If you have any feedback, suggestions, or bug reports, please let me know. I am always looking to improve this software.

Determining the truth is an exercise left to the reader.
