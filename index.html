<h2>Welcome to the personal website for Kyle Hankins.</h2>
<br>

<br>
The following is a collection of largely disconnected thoughts on software engineering, 
music and its creation, and entertainment of all sorts (in particular, tabletop and video gaming 
are likely to be well-represented.)
<br>
<br>
In addition, you will find on this site links to many of my projects, both personal and professional. 
If you have questions, concerns, or coinciding interests, please feel free to reach out to me 
using any of the available social media links.
